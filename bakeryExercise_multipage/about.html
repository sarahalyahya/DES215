          Sweet Crumbs has been serving our community since 2010. We believe in
          using simple, high-quality ingredients to create cookies that taste
          like home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every cookie is handmade in small batches using our grandmother's
          time-tested recipes. No preservatives, no shortcutsâ€”just real
          ingredients and lots of love.
