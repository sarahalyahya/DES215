        <h1>Web Design is 95% Typography</h1>
        <blockquote>
            Since almost all of the information on the web is written language, 
            it is only logical that a web designer should get good training in 
            the main discipline of shaping written information, in other words: 
            <span class="emphasis">Typography</span>

        <h2>Why Typography Matters</h2>
        <p>To be effective on a website, typography needs to be clean, clear, 
        appealing, and readable. Good web typography can attract, engage, and 
        keep your viewer on your site.</p>
        
        <p>Using font properties allows us to have huge control when styling text.</p>
